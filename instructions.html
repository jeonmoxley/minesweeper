        <li>In the first step, the player has to click on a random square and just hope it's not a bomb.</li>

        <li>If the player clicks on a safe area, the square will either open up to be blank (which is mine) or will contain a number from 1 to 8.</li>

        <li>These numbers specify the number of bombs that are adjacent to that square, i.e. n means there are n bombs adjacent to that square.</li>

        <li>This way the player needs to go ahead with calculating which square can contain the bombs. These calculations are to be performed based on multiple squares which can determine the probability of a square having bombs.</li>

        <li>If the player clicks on a unsafe square which contains bomb, the game gets over.</li>
